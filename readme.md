# Modelling Canadian vs. German Highways

Highway model referred from Allen Downey's think complexity

Jupyter notebook generates two highway models.

Highways are two lanes.

In the Canadian model, vehicles change lanes as required by traffic flow with defined speed limits.

German highway model mimics the autobahn enforcing the outside lane as a passing lane and inside lane
as the cruising lane.

The notebook reports number of crashes and the average traffic flow in each model.
